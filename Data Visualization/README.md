## Describe the format of the data

The data essentially had structures for planets. These structures held real information about the properties of the planets in our solar system
such as there position, name, velocity, distance, color, and size.


## How did you pre-process your data, if at all?
It was not really necessary to pre-process as all had to do was transfer the information into usuable structures.

## How are you visualizing the data?

I bascically recreated how the solar system would appear. The distance between the sun and the 5th planet jupiter is so great that it cannot fit on the screen.
If I scaled down the depiction to include all planets the size of the planets would be too small, making the color property and size proprty pointless. However,
while the planet to planet scale is correct, the planet to star (sun) scale is not correct as the sun is simply too big to even represent 3 other planets on a true scale.

## What did you notice about this data that you didn't anticipate?

I did not anticipate the the disance between planets would be so large that I could not fit the entire solar system onto the screen


## What do you want the visitor to your page to understand about this data?

I want the user to understand that this data can be used to properly create an model of our solar system. The visualization is limited due to limit screen space.
