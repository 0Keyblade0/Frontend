## Which systems behaved like you expected? Which ones surprised you? In which ones did your initial idea evolve into something different?

My version of the wind system behaved as I expected because I wanted the mouse to act as a leafblower. However, I
did not think that to get that behavior the mouse would need to be placed outside of the canvas. My version of
the basic pariticle surprised me because it initially starts out as something similar to the original, but over
time it devolves into chaos, which is definitely interseting to see. My inital idea evolved into something
different multiple times for the boids, but eventually, I ended up going back to my original idea: the Wolf Pack.
-- Use this answer to remind yourself what you tried and what worked or didn't--

## Describe your 1st system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

This ueses basic particles and basic forces. It is similar to the starter code but differs
in that it devolves into chaos. The force principles are still the same but how they are implemented is slightly
altered to create a system that starts in unity and devolves into chaos.
-- If your work is at all close to the example code, be sure to describe how it is different --
-- What techniques and P5 tools did you use? Help the TA/reviewer understand how it works --

## Describe your 2nd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

This uses wind particles. It is similar to the starter code but has some differences.
For one, this system interacts with the mouse. You can get the mouse to behave as a leafblower if placed
outside of the canvas.

## Describe your 3rd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

This 3rd system uses spring forces. This is one is similar to the starter code however, unlike the starter code,
a steady state for the springs does not exist. This causes a situation where they are always moving, searching for
the equilibrium that does not exist.

## Describe your 4th system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?

This 4th sustem uses boids forces. This is similar to the starter code but differs in that the system acts like a wolf pack.
Stalks (chases) and surrounds the prey, which is the mouse.

## Which system has one particle uses "particle-to-all-particles" forces (Boids style) or reads a map (Braitenberg-style). Explain how.

4th - Wolf Pack

## Which system has particles that leave a trail or creates new particles

4th - Wolf Pack

## Which system interacts with user behavior, and how?

1st - Basic
2nd - Wind
4th - Wolf Pack
