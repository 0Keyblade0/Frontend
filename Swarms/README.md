## 1st system. Forces used. Emergent behavior.

This uses basic particles and basic forces. It is similar to the starter code but differs
in that it devolves into chaos. The force principles are still the same, but how they are implemented is slightly
altered to create a system that starts in unity and devolves into chaos.
-- If your work is at all close to the example code, be sure to describe how it is different --
-- What techniques and P5 tools did you use? Help the TA/reviewer understand how it works --

## 2nd system. Forces used. Emergent behavior.

This uses wind particles. It is similar to the starter code but has some differences.
For this one, the system interacts with the mouse. You can get the mouse to behave as a leafblower if placed
outside of the canvas.

## 3rd system. Forces used. Emergent behavior.

This 3rd system uses spring forces. This is one is similar to the starter code; however, unlike the starter code,
a steady state for the springs does not exist. This causes a situation where they are always moving, searching for
the equilibrium that does not exist.

## 4th system. Forces used. Emergent behavior.

This 4th system uses Boids forces. This is similar to the starter code but differs in that the system acts like a wolf pack.
Stalks (chases) and surrounds the prey, which is the mouse.
