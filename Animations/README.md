Firework - Initially, small explosion. After rotating circles reach orgin, a bigger explosion occurs like in fireworks

Color Burst - Colorful continuous burst 

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

I enjoyed using the looping technique the most because it allowed me to add multiple objects to an animation with ease

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?
 
No I did not.

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?
 
I used the template that allowed me to calculate how long the loop would take then set that time to be the recording time.
