## **Generator 1:** what does this generate?

It generates jumping balls with eyes

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The most imporant qualitites are that the balls can jump at different heights and angles. Additionally, we can also change the size of the balls

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

size - size of the ball
aspectRatio - offset of jumps (look when music is playing)
angle - the angle at which the ball will jump)
hue - color of ball
brightness - brightness of ball
jumpDistance - how far the ball will jump

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

restingGolfball: [0.00,0.50,0.80,0.16,0.50,0.00] - does not move and is small
basketball: [0.70,0.00,0.50,0.10,0.36,0.52] - bounces moderately high and is a medium size
tableTennisBall: [0.03,0.00,0.03,0.18,0.44,1.00] - small but bounces very high (no offset or angle)
bowlingball: [1.00,0.38,1.00,0.36,0.00,0.00] - does not bounce (rolls back and forth)
wiffleball: [0.00,1.00,1.00,1.00,1.00,1.00] - bounces high and at an angle with offset

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things _can't_ it generate?

It can't generate anything where a core aspect is not jumping or bouncing

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

What was easy about making this generator was adding the jump slider. The code for jumping was already present; it jus needed an adjustment to have it work in tandem with a slider

## **Generator 2:** what does this generate?

It generates minerals in a mineral depsoit.

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The most important qualitites are the size, color, and refinement of the minerals that can be generated as well as their concealment.

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

size - size of mineral
width - makes the mineral wider
height - makes the mineral taller
angle - sets the mineral at an angle
hue - color of the mineral
hueOff - how the color changes towards the center of the mineral (more refinement)
brightness - brightness of the mineral
concealment - how well the mineral can be spotted
refinement - how many well-defined layers the mineral has

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

goldNugget: [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.50, 0.14, 0.50, 0.50, 0.40, 0.30] - small gold mineral (not too refined)
roseQuartz: [0.80, 0.54, 0.86, 0.20, 0.02, 0.62, 1.00, 1.00, 0.30] - large rose mineral (not too refined)  
amethyst: [0.32, 0.80, 0.06, 1.00, 0.76, 0.54, 0.50, 1.00, 1.00] - medium purple mineral (very refined)
timeStone: [0.30, 0.04, 0.38, 0.92, 0.30, 0.50, 0.48, 1.00, 0.20] - medium green mineral (somewhat refined)
diamond: [0.26, 0.30, 0.66, 0.66, 0.50, 0.56, 0.58, 0.34, 0.60] - medium light blue mineral (somewhat refined)

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things _can't_ it generate?

It cannot generate anything that does not relate to rhombus shaped objects.

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

The easy part about making this generator was the offset slider because it had already been done in the fish generator example.

## Which generator has a more interesting possibility space?

The Mineral Deposit definitely has a more interesting possibility space

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

None

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later

None
